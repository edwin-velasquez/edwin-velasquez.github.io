  	<p>
     When it comes to text communication, email is one of the only common denominators. Email marketing is vital for the success of many businesses. Mass Mailing allows the user to send their message to many clients at once. </p>
     <p> 
     One of the biggest issues in mass mailing is maintaining email server reputation. Even if you have a double opt-in list, there is no guarantee that your email server will continue maintain standings throughout its lifetime. There are some solutions out there but they tend to be expensive and they restrict the content of your email. The beauty behind Mass Mailer lies in its ability to send each email from a different SMTP server allowing you to bypass restrictions set by email service providers and email reputation algorithms. By adding multiple email servers you can rotate them per email recipient, lessening the reputation hit an email server would would get if it sends an email deemed to be seen as spam. You can also take advantage of the plethora of email service providers, such as Gmail and Yahoo.</p>

   <ul>
		<li>Rewrite the table engine. I currently use excellent library names will_filter but as the application gets more complex I am going to need more control over the information displayed. I believe features should be built to the applications needs and not the other way around. </li>

		<li>Create a back-end that allows the user to interact with emails that have yet to be sent</li>
