     Mapit is a tiled based map engine using Rails, HTML5, and Javascript. Mapit allows users to creat beautiful and functional maps without the need to write complex code.

  <div class="header project_sub_header"> Introduction </div>
    <p>
    Mapit is inspired by the idea of creating a game development engine that allows users to create mobile games without the need to know how to write a single line of code. Mobile games have taken a strong hold of the casual gaming market. Users, ranging from toddlers to senior citizens, are spending countless hours playing mobile games. If we can open up the development process to anyone with an idea  it is unimaginable what they will come up with. Most importantly it would introduce a new section of the population to the beauty that accompanies software development. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Tackling this project as a whole would have been time consuming so I decided to take a portion of the project and create a proof-of-concept. In a perfect world the engine would comprise of three different portions. The front end which allows the user to create maps in a drag and drop environment , a scripting language that would be generated by the front end, and a back end that reads the script and displays the map. The current incarnation is focused on the last two portions as they are required to create a demonstration of the potential of the application.
     </p>
     <div class="header project_sub_header"> Emphasis on Learning </div>
     <p>
     Every project I create is an opportunity to learn and this one is no different.  While there are a few game engines that would make this project much easier, I decided not to use them. The challenge to create everything from scratch is too enjoyable to have passed up. Half of being a developer is putting on your detective hat. Trying to find the boundaries of between what is possible and what is not.  The journey teaches you more than any book or tutorial ever will. This journey  has been  both enjoyable and informative. </p>
      <div class="header project_sub_header"> Scripting </div>
    <p>
Creating a scripting language that is readable is paramount to the success of the project.  My vision for this type application goes beyond the end product. I want this project to introduce people to the world of game and web development. By allowing users the ability to code by hand if desired, they will have full control of the end game. A user can create a games as simple or as complex as they desire. This approach also allows us to include features that could only be accessed by scripting and as a result we don't have to cram every feature imagined into the front-end. 


    </p>
    <div class="header project_sub_header"> Back-end </div>
    <p>
    The back-end is responsible for parsing the script and executing the information. To parse and store information we use the web development platform Ruby on Rails. Rails allows us to take the information from the script file store it in a usable JSON format for the java script to read. This is great because it cuts the amount of time need for the map to be loaded once a request is made by the browser. Traditionally, map information is gathered from an external file when the user first encounters the map. This leads to long load times because the information is parsed as the gamer waits.  
    </p>
    <div class="header project_sub_header"> Layers </div>
    <p>
Maps are composed of layers.  Layers are broken down into three different categories. The categories are image layers, fill layers and tile layers. An image layers is a layer composed of, as the name implies, an image. By taking advantage of opacity, transparency, and scrolling you can create interesting effects such as rain or trees at different distances by scrolling them at different speeds.   The fill layer is a layer made of a color that fills the screen. This is great to use both as a background and over heads. With opacity you can take a fill layer and turn it into a filter. With the addition of opaqueness you can turn a take the map and turn day to night
    </p>
    <p>
    The most important type of layer is a tile layer.  A tile layer take images from a tileset and converts them into complex looking map. Apart from displaying them normally, tile layer can be scrolling, allowing for effect such as moving clouds,  or displayed in sequence to emulate the fluidity of water. 
    </p>

    This is just a small portion of a bigger project I wish to complete in the not so distance future. I appreciate the time you took to look through the project and please don't hesitate to contact me.
