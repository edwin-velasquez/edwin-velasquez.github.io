                <p>
                    For my next project I am going to take a different approach. I want to work on a problem I that I have encountered but have not come up with a general solution to solve it. Often when I start a project, I tend to have a idea of the end product and some of the
                    steps I am going to take. Finding out if my preconceived solutions works tends to be a driving force in finishing the project. This time am going to start with the problem and create different solutions to solve it.</p>
                <p>
                    I want to create a new messaging system that allows us to chat about live events, such as a TV episode or sports event, in a seamless and natural way. The idea for this project stems for my love of baseball. Unfortunately I donâ€™t have many friends who
                    understand this beautiful game and most of the times I end up watching games on my own. Forums are a great medium to talk but for a real time conversation it tends to be cumbersome especially since you have to constantly refresh and
                    take multiple steps to post a message. Chat rooms tends to alleviate some of these frustration but are not without many faults. For one, if you are in a large chat room your messages tend to get lost as many others are communicating
                    with each other at the same time. What is the optimal system for a live conversation among many people observing the same event? That is the problem I am trying to solve.

                <div class="header project_sub_header">Power of Uncertainty</div>
                <p>
                    The uncertainty of the end result is what excites me the most. The openness problem allow me to create without barriers. There is so much of the project that needs to be created before I start to code it. I can take this project in any direction and will be the canvas portrays my creativity.

                <p>
                    I am going to start this project by writing a very simple real time chat program. This application serves two purposes. First, it puts me in the mind set to tackle the bigger problem and jump starts my thought process. This project also serves as a sandbox to test possible features I might include in the project. For this mini program I will be using Node.js, Socket.io, and Redis.
